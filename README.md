## React Native Yes No Oracle Phone App
This very basic React Native Phone App for answering questions. It uses the Giphy API, requiring GIPHY API KEY for gifs to appear. If you don't have a key the app still works, but you won't see any gifs. You should have the Expo App on your phone (https://expo.io/) 
## Giphy API Key
This requires a Giphy API key to work.
* Get free Giphy Api key from https://developers.giphy.com/
* In the project directory where the package.json resides, create a file named 'secret.js':
```javascript
module.exports = 'YOUR API KEY GOES HERE';
```
## To Run
Install dependencies

```javascript
 npm install
```

Once they are installed, run the server:

```javascript
 npm start
```

* Your browser will open a page with QR Code. 
* Open the Expo app and scan the code. The app will open on your phone.
